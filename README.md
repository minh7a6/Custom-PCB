# Custom-PCB
This is where I put my pcb and schematic that I created and used for projects.
PCB is created in Autodesk EAGLE.
For company to make those and get all the , I would recommend easyeda and lcsc for those since they are fast and quite cheap
You can use it and do whatever you want to do.
Feel free to put any request or issues. Because I'm still 17 so mistakes is unavoidable.
Enjoy :)
